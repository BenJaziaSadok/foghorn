# What is Foghorn?

Foghorn is a flexible and reliable cloud notification service ([reminiscent of SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/)) facilitating the definition of topics through which messages can be published and consumed in [pub/sub fashion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern) by authorised users.

It can be utilized by other cloud services (e.g. monitoring, autoscaling) or arbitrary systems to publish information of interest. Foghorn makes it simple to pass messages to both human recipients and distributed services.

When subscribing to a topic of interest Foghorn users will specify a protocol (email, http, sms, etc.) through which they wish to consume the posted messages.

Topic owners may define permissions specifying who is allowed to do what for a given topic under what conditions (example: "Joe may subscribe to the 'HighLoad' topic provided he does so via the http protocol").

A message can be customised to have different payloads for each supported protocol e.g. a brief summary for 'sms' and a full content flavour for 'email'.

Last but not least users will be able to list the subscriptions for a given topic or all of them.
